# Progress
Current progress and future plans.
There is also a [github project](https://github.com/users/sillydan1/projects/6) for this, and I am debating which solution I should use / prefer. For now, both exist

## Planned / In Progress
### Release `v1.5.0` (Plugin infrastructure)
This milestone focuses on cleanup and plugin infrastructure. The goal is to make the plugin ecosystem more robust and easier to use and extend.
 - [ ] Purge github issues
  - [ ] Undo system overhaul (make it diff-based)
  - [ ] Wrapper for the `addListener` / `removeListener` boilerplate pattern
 - [ ] Language bindings
   - [ ] Python bindings
   - [ ] Lua bindings [LuaJava](https://github.com/gudzpoz/luajava/tree/main).
 - [ ] Plugin Repository with some exploration / browsing built in
  - [ ] `std` sidepanel for plugin browsing

## Backlog
These are the ideas that are not yet planned, but are on the radar.
 - [ ] TIOA syntax
 - [ ] Diff view
 - [ ] TA syntax
 - [ ] CD (needs a pre-release for prototyping purposes)
   - [ ] flathub
 - [ ] Web based view
 - [ ] CodeArea tree highlighter implementation
 - [ ] Trace-traverser & specification
 - [ ] Plan for git integration
 - [ ] Planarity Embedding / autoformatting
 - [ ] DAP like specification
   - [ ] Protobuf specification
   - [ ] Implement `IDap` / `IDapEngine` interfaces
 - [ ] Clean up `DI` usage
   - [ ] Create some analysis tools, maybe a dependency graph from where things are added and where they are retrived again.
